# Modern Web Development Projects
This repository contains web development projects created to build a deeper understanding of modern website design, user interaction, and input handling. Projects focus on responsive layouts, clean UI design, and how front-end components interact with backend services using common HTTP methods such as GET and POST.

Current projects include:
- Portfolio Website – Responsive personal site showcasing projects and skills (very little JS)
    - Can be accessed [here](https://bryanemtman.github.io/webpages/portfolio/).
- Mock Login Page – Simulated authentication interface to study form input handling and HTTP request behavior
